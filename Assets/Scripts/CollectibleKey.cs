/// Description: Handles the behavior of a collectible key in the game. 
///              When the player interacts with the key, it plays a sound effect, 
///              disables the keyâ€™s visual/physical presence, and informs the GameManager 
///              that the player has collected it. The key is then destroyed to prevent reuse.
